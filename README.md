# Big-Data-HW-1

This is Homework 1 for Big Data 
I have uploaded Project 5 Programming with Python Fall 2020. This was a weekly homework assingment to complete a course in Fordham University's Masters in Business Analytics. In this python notebook there are 18 questions completed. Question 1 uploads a picture from Fordham's website as the header. The remaining questions focus on 6 months of trading data for Tesla (TSLA). I checked the attirbutes and identified any missing variables. Columns were changed to be lowercase, the scale was adjusted in number of shares, the highest and lowest price was found. The data was then made into visuals to display closing prices and trading volume to determine if there is a correlation between the two. Other visuals show the number of days the closing price was over $400 and days where the trading price was above $300 and the trading volume was above avergae. The later was then made into a new datatframe and exported into an excel file.
